## What am I expected to do?

Make a 12-panel plot of the climatology (1 panel for each month) of your data. 
Make the plot look publication quality with titles, units, labels, good colorbar, continents, etc.  

Create a Github Issue for anything that you think could make your plot even nicer looking, but you don't know how to do or didn't have time to do. You should create at least 1 issue. We can always make our plots nicer.

## When is it Due?
Oct 21

## How to Turn it in?

Put it on your project Github
Send me an email or MS Teams Chat when it is ready and I will look at your Github
