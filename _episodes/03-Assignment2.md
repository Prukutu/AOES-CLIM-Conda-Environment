## What am I expected to do?

Make a 12-panel plot of the climatology (1 panel for each month) of your data. 
Make the plot look *publication quality* with titles, units, labels, good colorbar, continents, etc.  

Create a Github Issue for anything that you think could make your plot even nicer looking, but you don't know how to do or didn't have time to do. You should create at least 1 issue. We can always make our plots nicer.

## When is it Due?
Oct 13th (end of the day)

## How to Turn it in?

Put it on your project Github, place the link to the repo in the Blackboard Assignment #2 and submit it. Note that multiple submissions are allowed for each blackboard assignment, resubmitting the blackboard assignment will trigger a regrade as long as it is done before the end of the semester.
