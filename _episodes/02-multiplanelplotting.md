## Multi-panel Plotting

Often we want to plot multiple panels on a single page.   As an example, here's a [plot of multiple model forecasts](http://cola.gmu.edu/subx/forecasts/forecasts.html) from a project of Dr. Pegion's. 

This plot contains a grid with 9 panels, some of which show a map and some of which are empty.  We will learn several ways to plot multiple panels on the same page.

If it does not load (or does not load the figures and animation), go to nbviewer.jupyter.org and enter it in the search bar.
