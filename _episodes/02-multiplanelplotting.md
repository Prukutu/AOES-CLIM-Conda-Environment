## Multi-panel Plotting

Often we want to plot multiple panels on a single page.   As an example, here's a [plot of multiple model forecasts](http://cola.gmu.edu/subx/forecasts/forecasts.html)  from a project of mine. 

This plot contains a grid with 9 spaces, some of which show a map and some of which are empty.  We will learn several ways to make multiple panels on the same page. 

## `plt.subplot`

`Matplotlib` has a subplotting capability similar to `Matlab`.  We will test an exanple using Sea Surface Temperature data.
